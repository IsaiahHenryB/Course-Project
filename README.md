This is a log of my progress starting from Homework7.

I added a readme.md file to my repo as Kiki suggested so I literally had to
```bash
    $ touch
```
up on my terminal navigaion skills.

To keep track of each

During HW7 I was able to add some responsive text sizes via the vw(viewport width) unit in css like this:
```css
 /* defining font sizes for phones*/
h1{
    font-size: 4.5vw;
}
h2{
    font-size: 4vw;
}
h3{
    font-size: 3.5vw;
}
p,a,input,textarea{
    font-size: 3vw;
}
```
I also added 

```css
 overflow-x:auto;
```

to one of the containers that contained my table <span style="color: orangered">
but I couldn't get it to work properly. It was probably because of the display: flex; on that element but it would just keep trying to condense instead of flowing into a scroll section.</span>

I was able to successfully add the Bars icon to each page and make them appear at the proper breakpoints.

I was also able to get the footer to look as close as I could get it to the mockups.

Though it took some time and some choice words, I was able to add breakpoints to the Comic Card Page along with every page that contained a form.
